$h2 Migrating from Mojo's Maven Plugin for GWT

The ${project.name} is very different from Mojo's Maven Plugin for GWT.

To begin with, Mojo's plugin is tightly linked to a specific version of GWT,
whereas the ${project.name} is [independent of the GWT version](usage.html).
This means that when migrating, you have to add dependencies to `gwt-dev` and `gwt-codeserver` to your project.

The module is managed in `src/main/module.gwt.xml` by default.
When migrating your project, you have to either move your module file to `src/main/module.gwt.xml`
or disable the [`gwt:generate-module` goal](generate-module-mojo.html) by setting the `skipModule` configuration property to `true`.

Next, most goals of Mojo's plugin have no equivalent in the ${project.name}.
Only Mojo's plugin's `gwt:compile` and `gwt:run-codeserver` (and to some extent `gwt:run`) have equivalent goals,
namely [`gwt:compile`](compile-mojo.html) and [`gwt:codeserver`](codeserver-mojo.html) (and [`gwt:devmode`](devmode-mojo.html)) respectively.
The [`gwt:codeserver` and `gwt:devmode` goals](codeserver.html) are quite different from Mojo's `gwt:run-codeserver` and `gwt:run` though:
the ${project.name} has been designed from the beginning with multi-module projects in mind,
if only because _The Maven Wayâ„¢_ dictates to separate your client- and server-side code into separate modules (for many reasons).
I strongly believe this makes it much better, but that means it works quite differently.

Finally, the way you configure the plugin is much different:
the ${project.name} has few properties, and arguments are passed to GWT explicitly through list properties (`<compilerArgs>` et al.)
This allows the plugin to be usable with many versions of GWT,
and allows you to control the arguments' order (that one being important for GWT in some cases).
The downside is that it makes it harder to change the configuration on-the-fly through properties you could set on the command-line (for example);
an alternative is then to prepare some presets in profiles, and enable the appropriate ones as needed.
Don't forget to take advantage of [the `combine.children="append"` attribute](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Plugins),
particularly when defining such profiles.
